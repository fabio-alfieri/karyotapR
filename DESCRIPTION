Description: Analysis of DNA copy number in thousands of single cells using 
    custom genome-wide targeted DNA sequencing panels for the Mission Bio Tapestri platform.
    Users can easily parse, manipulate, and visualize datasets produced
    from the automated Tapestri Pipeline, with support for normalization, clustering, and copy number calling.
    Functions are also available to deconvolute multiplexed samples by genotype and parsing barcoded reads from
    exogenous lentiviral constructs.
